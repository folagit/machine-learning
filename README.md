# Solving Business Problems with Machine Learning

Machine learning plays a significant role in various aspects of our lives, including its application within the educational domains we engage with. It's undeniable that machine learning's influence in educational research and practice is expanding, albeit with certain uncertainties. The definition of this role is a matter we can collectively shape.

In these labs, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of machine learning and its specific applications in educational settings, particularly within the realm of *STEM education research*. Our journey will encompass four distinct labs as we progress through this course. You are required to complete three Labs:

-   **Lab 1**: Prediction: How is prediction different from explanation?
-   **Lab 2**: Interpretation: How do we interpret the accuracy of a machine learning model?
-   **Lab 3**: Feature Engineering: How can we make our model better?
-   **Lab 4**: Unsupervised methods: What if we do not have training data?

*(Introductory Presentation)[https://dritauma-nu.github.io/machine-learning/introductory-presentation.html#1]* 

**Machine Learning Learning Lab 1: Prediction**

We have some data and want to develop a prediction model. Supervised machine learning is suited to this aim. In particular, in this learning lab, we explore how we can train a computer to predict students' withdrawal from a course. We use a large data set, the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), focusing on student data at this point. Our model at this point is relatively simple, a generalized linear model.


**Machine Learning Learning Lab 2: Interpretation**

How do we interpret a machine learning model? What else can we say, besides how accurate a model is? This learning lab is intended to help you to answer these questions by examining output from a classification and a regression model. We again use the OULAD, but add an assessment file.


**Machine Learning Learning Lab 3: Feature Engineering**

Once we have trained a computer in the context of using supervised machine learning methods, we may realize we can improve it by adding new variables or changing how the variables we are using were prepared. We also use a random forest model, rather than the regression model we have been using. Also, we consider key feature engineering steps with interaction data from the OULAD data set.


**Machine Learning Learning Lab 4: Unsupervised Methods**

The previous three learning labs involved the use of data with known outcome variables in the first three learning labs. Accordingly, we explored different aspects of supervised machine learning. What if we have data without something that we can consider to be a dependent variable? Unsupervised machine learning methods can be used in such cases. Herein, we use Latent Profile Analysis with quantified, transcribed audio data from mathematics classrooms. We interpret the output of Latent Profile Analysis from a Computational Grounded Theory approach.

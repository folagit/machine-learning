Business Problems with Machine Learning</h1>
<p>Machine learning plays a significant role in various aspects of our
lives, including its application within the educational domains we
engage with. It’s undeniable that machine learning’s influence in
educational research and practice is expanding, albeit with certain
uncertainties. The definition of this role is a matter we can
collectively shape.</p>
<p>In these labs, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of machine
learning and its specific applications in educational settings,
particularly within the realm of <em>STEM education research</em>. Our
journey will encompass four distinct labs as we progress through this
course. You are required to complete three Labs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lab 1</strong>: Prediction: How is prediction different from
explanation?</li>
<li><strong>Lab 2</strong>: Interpretation: How do we interpret the
accuracy of a machine learning model?</li>
<li><strong>Lab 3</strong>: Feature Engineering: How can we make our
model better?</li>
<li><strong>Lab 4</strong>: Unsupervised methods: What if we do not have
training data?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Introductory Presentation</em></p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Learning Lab 1: Prediction</strong></p>
<p>We have some data and want to develop a prediction model. Supervised
machine learning is suited to this aim. In particular, in this learning
lab, we explore how we can train a computer to predict students’
withdrawal from a course. We use a large data set, the Open University
Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), focusing on student data at this
point. Our model at this point is relatively simple, a generalized
linear model.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Learning Lab 2: Interpretation</strong></p>
<p>How do we interpret a machine learning model? What else can we say,
besides how accurate a model is? This learning lab is intended to help
you to answer these questions by examining output from a classification
and a regression model. We again use the OULAD, but add an assessment
file.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Learning Lab 3: Feature
Engineering</strong></p>
<p>Once we have trained a computer in the context of using supervised
machine learning methods, we may realize we can improve it by adding new
variables or changing how the variables we are using were prepared. We
also use a random forest model, rather than the regression model we have
been using. Also, we consider key feature engineering steps with
interaction data from the OULAD data set.</p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Learning Lab 4: Unsupervised
Methods</strong></p>
<p>The previous three learning labs involved the use of data with known
outcome variables in the first three learning labs. Accordingly, we
explored different aspects of supervised machine learning. What if we
have data without something that we can consider to be a dependent
variable? Unsupervised machine learning methods can be used in such
cases. Herein, we use Latent Profile Analysis with quantified,
transcribed audio data from mathematics classrooms. We interpret the
output of Latent Profile Analysis from a Computational Grounded Theory
approach.</p>

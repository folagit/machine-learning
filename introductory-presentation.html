# Solving Business Problems using Machine Learning

---

# Goals for this class

### Over-arching goal:

- **Get started with applying machine learning methods in R** 

### What is the primary goal of machine learning?

- Things to learn --- predictive modeling, interpretation. feature engineering, and supervised and unsupervised methods
- Exploring the use of *tidymodels* R package

---

# One example of ML . . .

&lt;img src="img/gpt-4.png" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

*Builds upon supervised machine learning models--namely, deep neural networks, the likes of which can be estimated within R; the big advance has to do with the transformer architecture that allows for the fitting of more complex models. It is still important (maybe necessary) to learn about the foundational techniques and methodologies underlying GPT-4.*

# Overview of Machine Learning (ML)

---

# Defining ML

- *Artificial Intelligence (AI)* (i.e., [GPT-4](https://openai.com/api/))
: Simulating human intelligence through the use of computers
- *Machine learning (ML)*: A subset of AI focused on how computers acquire new information/knowledge

This definition leaves a lot of space for a range of approaches to ML

---

# Supervised &amp; Unsupervised

## Supervised ML

- Requires coded data or data with a known outcome
- Uses coded/outcome data to train an algorithm
- Uses that algorithm to **predict the codes/outcomes for new data** (data not used during the training)
- Can take the form of a *classification* (predicting a dichotomous or categorical outcome) or a *regression* (predicting a continuous outcome)
- Algorithms include:
  - [Linear regression (really!)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
  - Logistic regression
  - Random forest
  - Neural network

---

# What kind of coded data?

&gt; Want to detect spam? Get samples of spam messages. Want to forecast stocks? Find the price history. Want to find out user preferences? Parse their activities on Facebook (no, Mark, stop collecting it, enough!) (from [ML for Everyone](https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/))

In educational research:

- Assessment data (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09895-9))
- Data from log files ("trace data") (e.g., [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2013.837391?casa_token=-8Fm2KCFJ30AAAAA%3Altbc8Y8ci_z-uLJx4se9tgvru9mzm3yqCTFi12ndJ5uM6RDl5YJGG6_4KpUgIK5BYa_Ildeh2qogoQ))
- Open-ended written responses (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09889-7), [2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-020-09761-w))
- Achievement data (i.e., end-of-course grades) (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09888-8), [2](https://search.proquest.com/docview/2343734516?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true))

# How is this different from regression?

The _aim_ is different, the algorithms and methods of estimation are not (or, are differences in degree, rather than in kind).

In a linear regression, our aim is to estimate parameters, such as `\(\beta_0\)` (intercept) and `\(\beta_1\)` (slope), and to make inferences about them that are not biased by our particular sample.

In an ML approach, we can use the same linear regression model, but with a goal other than making unbiased inferences about the `\(\beta\)` parameters:

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;center&gt;In supervised ML, our goal is to minimize the difference between a known `\(y\)` and our predictions, `\(\hat{y}\)`&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

---

# So, how is this really different?

This _predictive goal_ means that we can do things differently:

- Multicollinearity is not an issue because we do not care to make inferences about parameters
- Because interpreting specific parameters is less of an interest, we can use a great deal more predictors
- We focus on how accurately a _trained_ model can predict the values in _test_ data
- We can make our models very complex!

---

# Okay, _really_ complex

- Neutral/deep networks
  - i.e., GPT-3 (175 B parameters), GPT-4 (&gt;1 T parameters)
- And, some models can take a different form than familiar regressions:
  - *k*-nearest neighbors
  - Decision trees (and their extensions of bagged and random forests)
- Last, the modeling process can look different:
  - Ensemble models that combine or improve on ("boosting") the predictions of individual models

---
# Machine Learning Workflow

- Machine learning is a systematic approach to teaching computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.  
- Understanding the machine learning workflow is essential for successful model development.
- Machine learning workflow involves data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, deployment, and maintenance.
---

# Supervised &amp; Unsupervised

## Unsupervised ML

- Does not require coded data; one way to think about unsupervised ML is that its purpose is to discover codes/labels
- Can be used in an _exploratory mode_ (see [Nelson, 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124118769114?casa_token=EV5XH31qbyAAAAAA%3AFg09JQ1XHOOzlxYT2SSJ06vZv0jG-s4Qfz8oDIQwh2jrZ-jrHNr7xZYL2FwnZtZiokhPalvV1RL2Bw)) 
- **Warning**: The results of unsupervised ML _cannot_ directly be used to provide codes/outcomes for supervised ML techniques 
- Algorithms include:
  - Cluster analysis and Latent Profile Analysis
  - [Principle Components Analysis (really!)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)

---

# What technique should I choose?

Do you have coded data or data with a known outcome -- let's say about K-12 students -- and, do you want to:

- _Predict_ how other students with similar data (but without a known outcome) perform?
- _Scale_ coding that you have done for a sample of data to a larger sample?
- _Provide timely or instantaneous feedback_, like in many learning analytics systems?

**Supervised methods may be your best bet**

---

# What technique should I choose?

Do you not yet have codes/outcomes -- and do you want to?

- _Achieve a starting point_ for qualitative coding, perhaps in a ["computational grounded theory"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124117729703) mode?
- _Discover groups or patterns in your data_ that may be of interest?
- _Reduce the number of variables in your dataset_ to a smaller, but perhaps nearly as explanatory/predictive - set of variables?

**Unsupervised methods may be helpful**

# Labs Overviews

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Overview]

**What will I learn in this topic area?**

We'll work to answer these four questions:

- Lab 1: Prediction: How do predictive models differ from other models?
- Lab 2: Interpretation: How do we interpret the accuracy of a prediction model?
- Lab 3: Feature Engineering: How can we make our model better?
- Lab 4: Unsupervised methods: What if we do not have training data?

]

.panel[.panel-name[Lab 1]

**Machine Learning Learning Lab 1: Prediction**

We have some data and want to develop a prediction model. Supervised machine learning is suited to this aim. In particular, in this learning lab, we explore how we can train a computer to predict students' passing a course. We use a large data set, the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), focusing on student data at this point. Our model at this point is relatively simple, a generalized linear model.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Lab 2]

**Machine Learning Learning Lab 2: Interpretation**

How do we interpret a machine learning model? What else can we say, besides how accurate a model this? This learning lab is intended to help you to answer these questions by examining output from a classification and a regression model. We again use the OULAD, but add an assessment file.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Lab 3]

**Machine Learning Learning Lab 3: Feature Engineering**

How do we interpret a machine learning model? What else can we say, besides how accurate a model this? This learning lab is intended to help you to answer these questions by examining output from a classification and a regression model. We again use the OULAD, but add an assessment file.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Lab 4]

**Machine Learning Learning Lab 4: Unsupervised Methods**

The previous three learning labs involved the use of data with known outcome variables in the first three learning labs. Accordingly, we explored different aspects of supervised machine learning. What if we have data without something that we can consider to be a dependent variable?Â Unsupervised machine learning methodsÂ can be used in such cases. Herein, we use Latent Profile Analysis with quantified, transcribed audio data from mathematics classrooms. We interpret the output of Latent Profile Analysis from a Computational Grounded Theory approach.
